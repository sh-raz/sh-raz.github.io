# My Portfolio

Hello! I am Shilan. Here are some of the projects I've worked on while learning and honing my iOS development skills. These projects showcase my progress as I continue to grow as an iOS developer.

**Project Preview** 

## Voice Recorder
I implemented this simple voice recorder to gain experience working with the AVFoundation framework. The design of this app is inspired by the Recorder app on Xiaomi phones, but all UI elements were implemented from scratch by me. Its main functionalities—recording, playback, saving, and deleting voice files—are working, but it still requires some refinements. In the future, I plan to add improvements and enhance the project further.
