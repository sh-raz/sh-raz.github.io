# My Portfolio

Hello! I am Shilan. Here are some of the projects I've worked on while learning and honing my iOS development skills. These projects showcase my progress as I continue to grow as an iOS developer.

This simple chat app is using firebase email/password authentication and Firebase storage for storing profile images. HashChat is an ongoing project that I am actively developing. While the core functionality is in place, I am continuously working on improvements and adding new features to enhance the user experience.

## Voice Recorder
I implemented this simple voice recorder to gain experience working with the AVFoundation framework. The design of this app is inspired by the Recorder app on Xiaomi phones, but all UI elements were implemented from scratch by me. Its main functionalities—recording, playback, saving, and deleting voice files—are working, but it still requires some refinements. In the future, I plan to add improvements and enhance the project further.

- UICollectionView compositional layout
- FileManager for persistence locally

## RCInfo
RCInfo is a simple iOS app I built after I finished Sean Allen's Take Home course. This app allows users to search for countries and view detailed information, including flags, capitals, regions, and subregions. I used REST Countries RESTful API to get information about countries.
