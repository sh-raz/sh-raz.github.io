# My Portfolio

Hello! I am Shilan. Here are some of the projects I've worked on while learning and honing my iOS development skills. These projects showcase my progress as I continue to grow as an iOS developer.

## Voice Recorder
I implemented this simple voice recorder to gain experience working with the AVFoundation framework. The design of this app is inspired by the Recorder app on Xiaomi phones, but all UI elements were implemented from scratch by me. Its main functionalities—recording, playback, saving, and deleting voice files—are working, but it still requires some refinements. In the future, I plan to add improvements and enhance the project further.

## RCInfo
RCInfo is a simple iOS app I built after I finished Sean Allen's Take Home course. This app allows users to search for countries and view detailed information, including flags, capitals, regions, and subregions. I used REST Countries RESTful API to get information about countries.
